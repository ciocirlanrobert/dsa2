For this problem we use a trivial algorithm, just initialize two variables min and max, then iterate through the elements of the array and compare the current element with min and max. If the current element is smaller than the current min, modify min, and if the current element is greater than the current max, modify max.

Complexities:
	=> Time: O(n)
	=> Space: O(1)
