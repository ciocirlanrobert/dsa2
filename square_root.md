For this problem, to find the floor of the square root of a a given number, I used binary search since the requested complexity is O(logn). I basically find the highest perfect square smaller than my given number, and its square root is also the square root of my number.

Complexities:
	=> Time: O(log n)
	=> Space: O(1)
